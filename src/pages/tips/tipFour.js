                As the cryptoeconomy grows and evolves, there are more ways than ever to
                earn rewards for holding crypto, learning about crypto, or interacting with
                decentralized finance (or DeFi) apps. Most of these opportunities are
                available right inside the main Coinbase app or website, while the last one
                requires the use of a wallet with a DeFi browser built in, like Coinbase
                Wallet . We’ll walk you through the basics of some of the best ways to grow
                your crypto via rewards right now.

            <h2>1. Coinbase learning rewards</h2>
            <p />
            <p>
                The easiest way to start generating crypto rewards on Coinbase is through
                Coinbase Earn. In exchange for learning the basics about certain
                cryptocurrencies (usually by watching short videos), you can get some to try
                for yourself.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the launch of Coinbase Earn in 2018, users have received more than
                $100 million in crypto including 0x, Basic Attention Token, Zcash, Stellar
                Lumens, EOS, Dai, Tezos, Orchid, Compound, Celo, Nucypher, and the Graph.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>2. Stake some of your crypto</h2>
            <p />
            <p>
                Many cryptocurrencies now use a “Proof of Stake” consensus mechanism — which
                is a way their decentralized networks can ensure that all transactions are
                verified and secured without a bank or payment processor in the middle.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                With such cryptocurrencies, you can earn rewards simply for contributing to
                the security of the network — by “locking” some of your holdings into a
                staking pool for a certain timeframe. In exchange, you’ll earn rewards. This
                is an excellent option if you were planning to hold onto the crypto for a
                longer period — instead of having it sit idle, you can put it to work for
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Via the main Coinbase app or website, eligible users can stake Tezos,
                Cosmos, or ETH and earn as much as 5% interest (depending on the type of
                asset being staked) as of June 2021. Visit coinbase.com/staking to learn
                more.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>3. Turn your dollars into stablecoins</h2>
            <p />
            <p>
                One potential downside of staking rewards is that they’re paid in the native
                cryptocurrency, which can be volatile. But you can earn rewards simply by
                buying and holding dollar-pegged stablecoins like Dai and USD Coin (USDC).
            </p>
            <p>
                As of June 2021, you can earn 2.00% APY rewards by simply holding Dai in
                your Coinbase account. You can also earn 0.15% APY for holding USD Coin —
                and can earn even more via USDC Lending (see tip No. 4).
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>4. Lend some of your crypto with CeFi</h2>
            <p />
            <p>
                It can be challenging at times to hold dollars in a traditional savings
                account and earn meaningful yield. But stablecoins have made a very similar
                proposition possible. A growing number of centralized finance (or CeFi)
                products have emerged that provide compelling yield for keeping some of your
                crypto holdings in stablecoin form. Coinbase customers looking for a
                low-risk investment can start earning 4.00% APY via USDC. Crypto deposits
                aren’t insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or SIPC.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>5. Lend some of your crypto with DeFi apps</h2>
            <p />
            <p>
                If you’re comfortable with higher potential risks for higher returns, you
                can experiment with lending some of your crypto via DeFi apps. (DeFi remains
                an emerging technology, so make sure not to invest more than you can afford
                to lose if you decide to experiment with these protocols.)
            </p>
            <p>
                DeFi can enable transparent, peer-to-peer lending for potentially higher
                yields than traditional financial offerings. Investors that supply their
                cryptocurrency to DeFi lending protocols receive rewards in the form of
                interest that is charged to borrowers. You need a crypto wallet that is
                compatible with DeFi apps. Coinbase Wallet (which is a separate product from
                the main Coinbase app and can be used by anyone, not just Coinbase
                customers).Via Coinbase Wallet, you can experiment with lending some of your
                crypto — the simplest way to start is with a stablecoin — via DeFi protocols
                such as Compound or Aave.
