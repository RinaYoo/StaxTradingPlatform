            In December 2017, an anonymous crypto investor named “Pine” created the
            Pineapple Fund as “an experiment in philanthropy with cryptocurrency.” Pine
            donated $55 million worth of bitcoin to 60 different charitable
            organizations — focused on everything from the environment and mental health
            to social justice and homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charitable giving via crypto has become an increasingly popular choice for
            both individuals and organizations. Some of the world’s biggest charitable
            organizations — including the Red Cross and United Way — accept
            cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2018, GiveCrypto.org has been working to reduce poverty via direct
            community-based donations of cryptocurrency (Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is
            a founder). In 2019, UNICEF announced that it had become the first U.N.
            Organization to hold and make transactions in cryptocurrency, via a
            designated Cryptocurrency Fund. As of April 6th, 2021 the UNICEF
            Cryptocurrency fund has received 2,267 ETH and eight bitcoin (worth over $5
            million). You can also check out Daffy — a new giving platform that delivers
            all donations to nonprofits and charities in cash, and which allows you to
            choose from the more than 1.5 million organizations that Daffy supports.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being able to quickly and anonymously donate from any country in the world,
            without incurring high fees, is a technological innovation unique to crypto
            that is making donations more efficient, equitable, and easy.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Crypto is private</h2>
        <p />
        <p>
            Crypto can help address privacy and data protection issues, which are
            increasingly relevant to donors. A 2021 survey by Give.org showed that a
            large majority of Americans of all ages have data-privacy concerns when it
            comes to philanthropy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Donating crypto directly to an organization could better protect your
            personal information, and potentially result in more funds going to causes
            you care about.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Crypto can have tax advantages</h2>
        <p />
        <p>
            Let’s say you bought $2,000 in bitcoin over a year ago. As of April 2021,
            the fair market value is now $5,500. You decide to donate the full amount to
            your favorite IRS-recognized charitable organization. Here are two ways your
            contribution could play out:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sell bitcoin and donate in dollars:</b>
            If you were to sell the bitcoin first and then donate dollars, you might
            incur a long-term capital gains tax of up to 20 percent (not accounting for
            additional Medicare surtax or state and local taxes) — which would be around
            $700.
        </p>
        <p>Final donation given: Approximately $4,800.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Donate bitcoin directly: </b>
            If you were to donate the bitcoin directly, your tax-deductible contribution
            could go much further. With a direct donation, you might not have to pay
            capital gains tax on the bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>Final donation received: Approximately $5,500.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Crypto donations can be cheaper for organizations to process</h2>
        <p />
        <p>
            {" "}
            According to the 2020 Global Trends in Giving Report, 63 percent of donors
            worldwide prefer to donate online via debit or credit card. But given by
            card can reduce the actual donation organizations receive — because
            processing can fees range anywhere from 2.2 to 7.5 percent (according to
            Charity Navigator, a non-profit that rates online-donation processors){" "}
        </p>
        <p>
            How much of a difference might that make? Let’s say you wanted to donate
            $1,000.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Donate via credit card:</b>
            the processing fees incurred by the organization could be as high as $75.
        </p>
        <p>Final donation received: $925</p>
        <p>
            <b>Donate via crypto: </b>
            the same donation made in bitcoin would incur a transaction fee of about
            $8.70 (calculated using the median transaction fee on April 6, 2021
            according to CoinMetrics.io).
        </p>
        <p>Final donation received: $991.28</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Stablecoins can make crypto giving less volatile</h2>
        <p />
        <p>
            Organizations looking to take advantage of the benefits of crypto without
            the volatility risk can also accept donations in USDC or similar
            stablecoins. USDC is a cryptocurrency that is fully backed and redeemable
            for US Dollars. Any organization that has Coinbase Commerce enabled is set
            up to accept USDC.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
            (If you’re an org looking to accept crypto you can set up a Coinbase
            Commerce account — within minutes, you’ll be able to accept donations in
            five different cryptocurrencies.)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Which nonprofits accept crypto?</h2>
        <p />
        <p>
            Whether you’re looking to support initiatives around clean water,
            early-childhood education, or human rights, dozens of organizations are
            already set up to accept donations today in crypto. Here are a range of
